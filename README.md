# kiwi the robot
`!!! work in progress !!!`

This project was forked from https://github.com/BtreeComputingServcies/pia-the-robot.
Thanks to "BtreeComputingServcies" for all the great work in 3D-design and programming!

### Why the fork?
I've forked the original "pia-the-robot" because i used different hardware components to power up my robot.

### Description
Kiwi is a small robot-companion which is inspired and copied from Alonso Martinez's "Mira". I saw this small guy and fell in love with it. So i had to build one!
